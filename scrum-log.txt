Plan for Scrum 1: 

Visual Overview: 




Tasks for Sprint 1: 
* Familiarise ourselves with the Dublin Bikes API, and as a secondary priority the Weather API. 
* Formalise a structure for how the data scraped from the API will be stored in the database. 
* Familiarise ourselves with the other technologies pertinent to the project: Amazon RDB, Amazon Hosting, Flask, SQL Alchemy. 
* Sign up for a Trello account and begin organising the project tasks through that. Look at how to convert to burndown charts. 
* Plan standups (may vary over the break in terms of what days suit – the team will decide on regular days prior to when classes recommence). 
* Set up scraper to scrape information from the APIs. (Priority: High 1)
* Set up database so that information can be stored immediately once scraper is ready. (Priority High 1)
* Create basic html/css front end site. (Priority: Medium 1)
* Set up Flask App to process queries to the database from the front end site. (Priority: Medium 2)
