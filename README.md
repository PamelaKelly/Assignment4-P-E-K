PLEASE NOTE: When a marker is clicked the most recent dynamic information for that station 
along with google charts for daily averages and hourly averages appear below. The performance of the site needs improvement, so it takes up to 30 seconds for the final chart to appear. 

Currently only the hourly data for Monday is displaying however it is particular for each station depending on the marker clicked.
